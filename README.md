 
      Analog Input, but with Serial Plotter!
      
     Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
     turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED)  connected to digital pin 13.
     The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on
     the value obtained by analogRead().
 
     The circuit:
     
     * Potentiometer attached to analog input 0
     * center pin of the potentiometer to the analog pin
     * one side pin (either one) to ground
     * the other side pin to +5V
     * LED anode (long leg) attached to digital output 13
     * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground
